# SciML Leeds SENSE training

Welcome to the Scientific Machine Learning Training page! In this training, we will delve into the fascinating intersection of scientific research and machine learning, specifically focusing on the application of autoencoders to explore satellite imagery over the UK.

## What is Scientific Machine Learning?
Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) is an emerging field that combines the power of traditional scientific methods with modern machine learning techniques. It aims to tackle complex scientific problems by leveraging the vast amounts of data available today, enabling researchers to gain deeper insights, make predictions, and discover new patterns.

## Using Autoencoders for Satellite Imagery Exploration
In this training, we will use autoencoders, a type of artificial neural network, to analyze and extract meaningful information from satellite imagery covering the landscapes of the UK. Autoencoders are particularly useful for tasks like image denoising, feature extraction, and even generation of new images.

## What to Expect

### Introduction to Autoencoders: We will start with an overview of autoencoders, understanding how they work and their applications in image analysis.

### Processing Satellite Imagery: Learn how to preprocess and prepare satellite imagery data for input into the autoencoder model.

### Training the Autoencoder: Step through the process of training an autoencoder model using TensorFlow, exploring how it learns to represent the unique features of UK landscapes.

### Visualizing Results: After training, we will visualize the reconstructed images, gaining insights into the model's understanding of the satellite data.
